# Process for building sensible models

1. Model Selection -> Use test and validation together with models that go from x^! to x^10.
2. Choose based on validation but also look at test result.
3. Check for Bias and variance using Cross validation and variance.
3. Check if regularazation helps, with various delta Choose the one that reduces JCV
4. Check the learning curve based on the behaviour of J-CV and J-train
  * Look out for high bias
  * and high variance
5.If all fails : use more than one model Bagging and Boosting.
