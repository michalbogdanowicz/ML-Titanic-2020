\section{Proposition}
The proposition is using a set of machine learning methods to predict the people that would survive the Titanic sinking of 15 April 1912.

The methods that have been used are:

\begin{enumerate}  
\item Logistic Regression TODO
\item Random trees TODO
\item Neural Networks TODO
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data}

	
The Data was incomplete. It was impossible to perform the best practices for evaluating a model. The test and training were arleady separated. So the complete dataset has been found. This can be tested by subimitting the predictions of the test to the kaggle.com site and the result will be 1.0 ( which is of course impossible, unless complete overfitting on full data is performed).
