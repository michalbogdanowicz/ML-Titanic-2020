\section{Proposition}
The proposition is using a set of machine learning methods to predict the people that would survive the Titanic sinking of 15 April 1912.

The methods that have been used are:

\begin{enumerate}  
\item Logistic Regression TODO
\item Random trees TODO
\item Neural Networks TODO
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data}

The Data propsed to the professor was incomplete. It heavily reduced the avialble data to perform the best practices for evaluating a model. The test and training were already separated and ground truth was missing. So the complete dataset has been taken from the internet. In addition the complete list of surviors can be found at the wikipedia page \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_RMS_Titanic}{here} (not a ML-friendly format).
This data sadly is used to cheat on the kaggle competition. Making it a quite infamous one.

\section{Logistic Regression}
The data cannot be used as it is.
The names are going to be deleted, as that should not inlfuence the resut.
